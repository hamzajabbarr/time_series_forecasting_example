# time_series_forecasting_example
This notebook is to help learners like myself to understand how we can use time series forecasting to solve business problems. 
The data and scenario are from Udacity's course on time series forecasting which is a part of the predictive analytics nanodegree. 
You can find more info regarding the course [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/predictive-analytics-for-business-nanodegree--nd008).


## Scenario:

You recently started working as a Business Analyst for a company that creates and sells video games. Your manager discusses a business problem with you and tasks you to come up with a solution.

The problem at hand is that the company's ordering method is not as efficient as it should be. The company is having a hard time trying to predict demand so that it can match ordering supplies to meet the need of its customers. The company doesn't want to bloat the demand estimation and end up with piles of unused stock. Similary they don't want to underestimate demand and run the risk of losing customers to competition. 

Your manager has tasked you to forecast monthly sales data in order to synchronize supply with demand, aid in decision making that will help build a competitive infrastructure and measure company performance. You, the business analyst, are assigned to help your manager run the numbers through a time series forecasting model.

Youâ€™ve been asked to provide a forecast for the next 4 months of sales and report your findings.

### Note:
During the course of this notebook I will use multiple time series model. I will try to explain them as simply as possible. To understand it further and in more detail I will post links to materials that I have found really helpful.

Initially I had solved the problems using Alteryx. I have posted the screenshot of the workflow below for anyone that might be interested is using Alteryx to create a workflow.
